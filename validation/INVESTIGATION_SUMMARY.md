# Investigation Summary: $114K Difference Between C++ and MT5

## Status: CRITICAL BUG FOUND

### The Discovery

I found that **swap fees were being double-counted** in our C++ implementation!

## The Bug Explained

### How It Happened

The swap fee processing had a fatal flaw:

**Step 1:** When daily swap was charged (lines 518-526):
```cpp
daily_swap += position_swap;
trade->commission += position_swap;  // ❌ BUG: Stored in trade
balance_ += daily_swap;              // ✅ Correctly deducted immediately
```

**Step 2:** When trade closed (lines 334-344):
```cpp
double profit = price_diff * trade->lot_size * config_.contract_size;
trade->profit_loss = profit - trade->commission;  // ❌ BUG: Deducted AGAIN
balance_ += trade->profit_loss;                    // ❌ Double deduction applied
```

### The Impact

**Swap was deducted TWICE:**
1. Immediately when charged: -$49,606.76
2. Again when trade closed: -$49,606.76
3. **Total deducted: -$99,213.52** (but only $49K was real!)

### The Paradox

**Before Fix (with bug):**
- C++ Final Balance: $544,784.33
- MT5 Final Balance: $430,579.99
- **Difference: +$114,204** (C++ higher)

**After Fix (corrected):**
- Expected C++ Final Balance: $594,391.09 (+$49,606.76)
- MT5 Final Balance: $430,579.99
- **Difference: +$163,811** (C++ even HIGHER!)

## Why This Is Concerning

The bug fix makes our results **WORSE**, meaning:

1. **The double-counting was accidentally making us closer to MT5**
2. **There's a BIGGER underlying difference of ~$163K**
3. **Something else is causing C++ to be more profitable**

## Possible Explanations

### Theory 1: MT5 Has Additional Costs

**Missing from C++:**
- Commission per trade?
- Additional spread markup?
- Slippage simulation?
- Regulatory fees?

**To Verify:**
- Check MT5 report for commission line items
- Compare spread values in ticks vs MT5's effective spread
- Look for any "other costs" in MT5 report

### Theory 2: Position Sizing Differences

Our binary search algorithm might be finding **larger optimal positions** than MT5:

**Why this matters:**
- Larger positions = more profit per pip
- Over 131,177 trades, small differences compound
- Need to compare lot sizes trade-by-trade

**To Verify:**
- Extract first 100 trades from both systems
- Compare lot sizes at same timestamps
- Check if C++ lots are consistently 10-20% higher

### Theory 3: Trade Execution Timing

With 96,279,625 ticks processed:
- Microsecond-level timing differences
- Grid level boundary calculations
- Tick interpretation differences

**Could explain:**
- Different entry prices (better fills in C++)
- More favorable exit prices
- Compounding over 131K trades

### Theory 4: MT5 Swap Calculation Different

MT5 might be charging swap differently:
- Different rollover time
- Different triple swap calculation
- Different swap rates than we fetched
- Swap-free days we're not accounting for

**To Verify:**
- Extract MT5 total swap from report
- Should be close to our -$49,606.76
- If significantly different, explains gap

## Action Plan

### Immediate Actions

1. **Run the fixed test** (no more double-counting):
```bash
cd validation
run_fixed_moneta_test.bat
```

2. **Wait for your MT5 re-run** to get fresh baseline data

3. **Extract MT5 swap total** from new report

### Investigation Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. ✅ Swap double-counting (FIXED)
2. 🔍 Position sizing comparison (next)
3. 🔍 Commission/spread analysis

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
4. Trade timing differences
5. MT5 swap calculation verification

**LOW PRIORITY:**
6. Floating-point precision differences
7. Rounding errors

## Expected Next Results

### Scenario A: Swap Fix Reveals Real Difference
```
C++ (fixed):  $594,391.09
MT5:          $430,579.99
Difference:   +$163,811.10 (+38%)
```

**Conclusion:** There's a massive difference beyond swap. Focus on position sizing.

### Scenario B: MT5 Charges Different Swap
```
If MT5 swap = -$163,811 total:
C++ final = $594,391 - $163,811 + $49,607 = $480,187
MT5 final = $430,580
Difference: +$49,607 (matches swap double-count)
```

**Conclusion:** Swap was the main issue all along.

### Scenario C: Commission Missing
```
If commission = $1.25/trade × 131,177 = $163,971
C++ final = $594,391 - $163,971 = $430,420
MT5 final = $430,580
Difference: -$160 (essentially equal!)
```

**Conclusion:** We're missing per-trade commission charges.

## Recommendation

**You mentioned you'll rerun MT5 tests.** Perfect! Here's what to extract:

### From MT5 Report:
1. Total swap charged
2. Total commission (if any)
3. Any "other costs" line items
4. First 20 trades with lot sizes
5. Final balance (confirm $430,579.99)

### From C++ Test (after you run):
1. Final balance (expected ~$594,391)
2. Total swap (should be -$49,606.76)
3. First 20 trades with lot sizes
4. Any error messages

### Comparison:
- If lot sizes match → investigate timing/execution
- If lot sizes differ → binary search issue
- If swap differs significantly → swap calculation issue
- If there's commission in MT5 → add to C++

# Update: 2026-01-10 - Triple Swap Timing Analysis

## Major Finding: Triple Swap Day Correction

**Problem**: C++ was charging triple swap on the WRONG day.

**Evidence from MT5 SQL Logs (DAY_CHANGE events)**:
```
2025.01.09 Thu: 0.08 lots, -15.60 swap, -195.00/lot (3.00x) *** TRIPLE
2025.01.10 Fri: 0.09 lots, -5.85 swap, -65.00/lot (1.00x) normal
2025.01.23 Thu: 0.08 lots, -15.60 swap, -195.00/lot (3.00x) *** TRIPLE
2025.01.30 Thu: 0.28 lots, -91.65 swap, -327.32/lot (5.03x) *** TRIPLE
```

Triple swap is charged on **THURSDAY**, not Wednesday!

**Root Cause**:
- MT5 `swap_3day=3` (Wednesday) indicates WHEN MARKET CLOSES for weekend swap
- Swap is actually CHARGED when market OPENS after that close
- Market closes ~23:00 Wednesday, opens ~01:00 Thursday
- Therefore triple swap is applied Thursday morning

**Fix Applied** (tick_based_engine.h:530):
```cpp
// Triple swap is charged on the day AFTER swap_3days
// e.g., swap_3days=3 (Wednesday) means triple is charged Thursday morning
int triple_swap_day = (config_.swap_3days + 1) % 7;
int swap_multiplier = (day_of_week == triple_swap_day) ? 3 : 1;
```

## Broker Terminal Mapping Confirmed

| Broker | Terminal ID | swap_long | swap_short | Trades | Total Swap | Net Profit |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Moneta | 5EC2F58E... | -65.11 | 33.20 | 145,466 | -$45,315 | $417,151 |
| Fusion | 930119AA... | -66.99 | 41.20 | 130,685 | -$43,148 | $320,580 |

## Swap Mode 1 (Points) Formula Verified

```
swap_USD = swap_points × point × contract_size × lot_size × multiplier

For XAUUSD:
- point = 0.01
- contract_size = 100
- swap_long = -65.11 points

Example (0.08 lots, triple swap):
  -65.11 × 0.01 × 100 × 0.08 × 3 = -15.6264 ≈ -15.63 USD ✓
```

## New Agents/Skills Created

1. `.claude/agents/validate-engine.md` - Deep investigation agent
2. `.claude/agents/sync-data.md` - Data synchronization agent
3. `.claude/agents/run-backtest.md` - Backtest execution agent
4. Updated `.claude/skills/debug-swap.md` with findings

## Tick Data Analysis

- Root `XAUUSD_TICKS_2025.csv` is IDENTICAL to `Fusion/XAUUSD_TICKS_2025.csv`
- Moneta has DIFFERENT tick data (different broker's feed)
- C++ test with root tick file should match Fusion, not Moneta

## Remaining Discrepancies

After triple swap fix, compare C++ vs Fusion:
- Trade count: ~131K (C++) vs 130,685 (Fusion) - close
- Profit: significant difference remains
- Need to investigate position sizing algorithm
