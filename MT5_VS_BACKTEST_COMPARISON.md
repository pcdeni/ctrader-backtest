| v4 Aggressive | $197,344.80 | **19.73x** | ~70% |

## Comparison Summary

| Strategy | MT5 | C++ | Ratio | Match |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|-------|
| v4 Aggressive | 19.73x | 21.37x | **1.08** | GOOD |
| v5 FloatingAttractor | 19.82x | 18.50x | **0.93** | GOOD |
| CombinedJu P1_M3 | 13.37x | 28.59x | **2.14** | DIFFER |

## Analysis

### v4 Aggressive: GOOD MATCH (Ratio 1.08)
- C++ outperforms MT5 by 8%
- Difference likely due to minor tick data or spread handling differences
- **Validates C++ backtest engine accuracy**

### v5 FloatingAttractor: GOOD MATCH (Ratio 0.93)
- MT5 slightly outperforms C++ by 7%
- Well within acceptable tolerance
- **Validates C++ backtest engine accuracy**

### CombinedJu P1_M3: SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCY (Ratio 2.14)
C++ returns more than 2x what MT5 shows. This is the most concerning discrepancy.

**Possible causes:**
1. **Velocity Filter Implementation Difference**
   - MT5 Strategy Tester may process ticks differently than raw tick files
   - MT5 might have tick aggregation or filtering that affects velocity calculations
   - The velocity window (10 ticks) may behave differently with MT5's tick delivery

2. **Circular Buffer Initialization**
   - C++ immediately uses ticks for velocity; MT5 may have warmup period
   - MT5 might block more entries early in the test

3. **Barbell Sizing Safety Factor**
   - Implementation of `1.0 / (1.0 + positionCount * 0.05)` may differ
   - Rounding or lot size normalization differences

4. **Trade Count Comparison**
   - C++ CombinedJu: 38,125 trades
   - Need to get MT5 trade count for comparison
   - If MT5 has significantly fewer trades, velocity filter is more aggressive

| VelocityThresholdPct | 0.01% | 0.01% |
| EnableBarbellSizing | true | true |
| BarbellThresholdPos | 1 | 1 |
| BarbellMultiplier | 3.0 | 3.0 |

**Parameters match exactly for CombinedJu** - discrepancy is implementation-related, not parameter-related.

## Market Conditions (2025.01.01 - 2026.01.27)
- **Price Range**: $2,614.75 - $5,110.89
- **Gold Hit ATH**: ~$5,111 in January 2026 (up ~96% from start!)
- **Total Ticks**: 57.16M (51.7M from 2025 + 5.45M from Jan 2026)

## Recommendations

### For v4/v5: Validated
- C++ backtest is reliable for these strategies
- Can confidently use C++ results for parameter optimization
- Small differences (~7-8%) are acceptable for this type of comparison

### For CombinedJu: Investigate Further
1. **Add diagnostic logging to MT5 EA** to count:
   - Total velocity filter blocks
   - Total entries allowed
   - Average TP set
   - Average lot size

2. **Compare trade-by-trade** between MT5 and C++ for first 100 trades

3. **Test with velocity filter disabled** in both MT5 and C++ to isolate the issue

4. **Check MT5 tick delivery** - use `CopyTicksRange()` vs `OnTick()` events

## Conclusion

The C++ backtest engine shows **excellent accuracy for v4 and v5 strategies** (within 7-8% of MT5). The **CombinedJu discrepancy requires investigation** - the velocity filter is the primary suspect since it's the most tick-timing-sensitive component of the strategy.

For production use:
- **v4 Aggressive**: Use MT5 results as reference (~20x return)
- **v5 FloatingAttractor**: Use MT5 results as reference (~20x return)
- **CombinedJu**: Conservatively use MT5 results (~13x return) until discrepancy is resolved
